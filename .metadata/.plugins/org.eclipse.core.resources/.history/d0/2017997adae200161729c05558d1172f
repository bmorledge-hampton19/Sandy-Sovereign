Your people have discovered a nearly empty bag of junk food
stuck in a nearby bush.  Presumably, it was left by some
careless beach-goer.  The smarties in your city devise a
plan to dislodge it using a makeshift catapult made from
driftwood and seaweed and using pebbles as ammunition.
The bag certainly has some delicious crumbs in it... Is
it worth the resources to build the catapult?

OPTION TEXT
Build it
NEXT
Not worth it

CREATE EVENT

SUCCESS TEXT
Construction of the catapult is no mean feat, but your
people manage it regardless.  Once finished, pebbles flung
at the bag knock it loose in no time.  Success!  The bag
flutters down and its delicious contents are yours!
NEXT
The food may be delicious, but it's simply not worth the
resources to you. You leave it to the seagulls and continue
on your merry way.

FAILURE TEXT
Although you wish to build the catapult, your supplies are
lacking.  The bag must be left alone and will most certainly
be gone by the time you get around to collecting the
necessary resources.  Ah well...

Your beautiful kingdom may have been high and dry for 
some time now, but high tide is fast approaching...
Quickly now!  Do you want to send out your people
to help bail out the moat as the tide encroaches,
or would they be better off staying inside and
leaving the moat to fend for itself...

OPTION TEXT
Have the people assist in
bailing out the moat.

Have the people remain

SUCCESS TEXT
Your hardworking people have succeeded in keeping the
moat from overflowing!  Some were washed out to sea,

Even without the help of your people, the moat did
its duty in protecting your walls and people.
On the downside, the moat will certainly need
attention before the next tide rolls along...

FAILURE TEXT
Despite their hard work, your people were unsuccessful
in keeping the tide from breaching your moat...
The ocean waves proceeded to wreack havoc on your 
walls and city, and many people were washed out to sea...
Needless to say, morale has plummeted.

leave them in the safety of their homes and hope against
hope that the walls do not fail...

Send out the people to

Ah! The sun is shining and the wind has calmed.  What perfect

your palisades will surely make your presence known, but
will that be enough?  Perhaps your people could help too...

shelter inside.

SUCCESS TEXT
Screaming and shouting at the top of their lungs, your

those remaining, but things could have been much worse!

Taking shelter inside, you leave the leg work up to your
palisades.  Fortunately, the sharp sticks seem to do the
trick all by themselves and your people remain safe inside
their homes.  Hooray!

FAILURE TEXT
Although your people try their best to get the attention
of the beach-goers, they are unsuccessful in keeping the
palisades up, and people and walls alike are soon trampled
underfoot...  So sad... :(
NEXT
Hoping that the palisades will be enough, your people

Today seems like a relatively peaceful day.  What to do?
Ah!  Perhaps it's best to work on shoring up defenses.
You never can be too careful, and who knows how close

Keep in mind, the walls require seashells, sand, and 
pebbles, the palisades require driftwood and seaweed,

dull work certainly doesn't help morale...)
