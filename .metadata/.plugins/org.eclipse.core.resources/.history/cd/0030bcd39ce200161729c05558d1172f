DESCRIPTION
Your beautiful kingdom may have been high and dry for 
some time now, but high tide is fast approaching...
Quickly now!  Do you want to send out your people
to help bail out the moat as the tide encroaches,
or would they be better off staying inside and
leaving the moat to fend for itself...

OPTION TEXT
Have the people assist in
bailing out the moat.
NEXT
Have the people remain 
inside the city walls.

CREATE EVENT

SUCCESS TEXT
Your hardworking people have succeeded in keeping the
moat from overflowing!  Some were washed out to sea,
and the rest aren't happy about it, but your walls
are certainly glad to be high and dry!
NEXT
Even without the help of your people, the moat did
its duty in protecting your walls and people.
On the downside, the moat will certainly need
attention before the next tide rolls along...

FAILURE TEXT
Despite their hard work, your people were unsuccessful
in keeping the tide from breaching your moat...
The ocean waves proceeded to wreack havoc on your 
walls and city, and many people were washed out to sea...
Needless to say, morale has plummeted.
NEXT
The moat did its best, but it wasn't enough to prevent
the tide from reaching your walls and dealing immense
damage to your infrastructure.  Your people aren't happy
with the outcome, but at least they were relatively safe
in their homes.
