to you.  He asks you: "What have you need of?"
Well...
What have you need of?

"Really?" The mysterious man says, raising one eyebrow.
"You seem to be pretty well off in that regard!"
He shakes his head sadly and begins to walk away.

DESCRIPTION
Your beautiful kingdom may have been high and dry for 
some time now, but high tide is fast approaching...
Quickly now!  Do you want to send out your people
to help bail out the moat as the tide encroaches,
or would they be better off staying inside and
leaving the moat to fend for itself...

OPTION TEXT
Have the people assist in
bailing out the moat.
NEXT
Have the people remain 
inside the city walls.

CREATE EVENT

SUCCESS TEXT
Your hardworking people have succeeded in keeping the
moat from overflowing!  Some were washed out to sea,
and the rest aren't happy about it, but your walls
are certainly glad to be high and dry!
NEXT
Even without the help of your people, the moat did
its duty in protecting your walls and people.
On the downside, the moat will certainly need
attention before the next tide rolls along...

FAILURE TEXT
Despite their hard work, your people were unsuccessful
in keeping the tide from breaching your moat...
The ocean waves proceeded to wreack havoc on your 
walls and city, and many people were washed out to sea...
Needless to say, morale has plummeted.
NEXT
The moat did its best, but it wasn't enough to prevent
the tide from reaching your walls and dealing immense
damage to your infrastructure.  Your people aren't happy
with the outcome, but at least they were relatively safe
in their homes.

DESCRIPTION
What's that!  On the horizon!  Oh no...
It's an angry (and hungry) herd of vicious crabs!!!!!!
To them, your people are no more than a delicious snack!
Your walls are all that stand between your people and
disaster!  Quickly!  Do you send your people out to 
attempt to reinforce the walls against the attack or
leave them in the safety of their homes and hope against
hope that the walls do not fail...

OPTION TEXT
Send out the people to
reinforce the walls.
NEXT
Keep them hunkered down
within the walls.

CREATE EVENT

SUCCESS TEXT
Your people work valiantly to brace the walls against attack
and are successful at holding up against the crabby onslaught!
Unfortunately, some of the people gave their lives for the
others' safety, and they are being mourned...
NEXT
Inside their homes, your people wait with baited breath,
hoping the walls will hold... 
Thankfully, they do!  The crabs lose heart eventually and
decide to look elsewhere for a meal.

FAILURE TEXT
Your people work valiantly to brace the walls against attack,
but the crabs' assault proves too vicious and the walls
are breached regardless!  The casualties are heavy, and
the survivors are distraught... Hopefully things will
be different next time...
NEXT
Inside their homes, your people wait with baited breath,
hoping the walls will hold... 
In a sudden turn of events, the crabs breach the wall
and set their sights on your people!  This can't be good...

DESCRIPTION
Ah! The sun is shining and the wind has calmed.  What perfect
weather... For careless beach-goers! Ack!!  Tourists and
locals alike have begun to storm the warm and sunny beach
with complete disregard for your people!  A sharp poke from
your palisades will surely make your presence known, but
will that be enough?  Perhaps your people could help too...

OPTION TEXT
Have your people make
their presence known.
NEXT
Have your people take
shelter inside.

CREATE EVENT

SUCCESS TEXT
Screaming and shouting at the top of their lungs, your
courageous sand people help to alert people to their 
presence and the palisades do the rest!  A few unlucky
souls will not be out to shout again, and this saddens
those remaining, but things could have been much worse!
NEXT
Taking shelter inside, you leave the leg work up to your
palisades.  Fortunately, the sharp sticks seem to do the
trick all by themselves and your people remain safe inside
their homes.  Hooray!

FAILURE TEXT
Although your people try their best to get the attention
of the beach-goers, they are unsuccessful in keeping the
palisades up, and people and walls alike are soon trampled
underfoot...  So sad... :(
NEXT
Hoping that the palisades will be enough, your people
take shelter in their homes.  Sadly, the beach-goers are
too many and too careless for your pointy sticks.  Before
too long, the palisades have failed and your walls and
people pay the price...

DISASTER



DESCRIPTION
Today seems like a relatively peaceful day.  What to do?
Ah!  Perhaps it's best to work on shoring up defenses.
You never can be too careful, and who knows how close
the next disaster is... What would you like to build up?
Keep in mind, the walls require seashells, sand, and 
pebbles, the palisades require driftwood and seaweed,
and the moat simply requires manpower (although such 
dull work certainly doesn't help morale...)

OPTION TEXT
Bail out the moat.
NEXT
Build up the walls.
NEXT
Put up palisades.

CREATE EVENT

SUCCESS TEXT
After a few hours of toiling away, your moat has been
dried out by your determined population!
NEXT
Your people get to work on repairing the walls with the
resources available.  Hopefully it'll be ready for the
next attack...
NEXT
Setting up palisades is no easy task, but with the
supplies that you have, your people seemed to have 
managed alright!

CONSTRUCTION



DESCRIPTION
Your people have come this far safely and they have you to
thank for that!  Perhaps it's time to take a breather and
consider the progress on the sand castle.  Might you be
able to spare the resources to expand it?  Keep in mind,
the disasters of the beach will only get more dangerous
while your castle remains incomplete...

OPTION TEXT
Build up the castle!
NEXT
Maybe next time...

CREATE EVENT

SUCCESS TEXT
Piling a great deal of your resources into the project,
you are able to make great progress on the castle!
It is another 20% close to completion...
NEXT
Wisely, you decide that the construction of the castle
must be placed after the direct needs of your people.
Hopefully in the future you will have more to spare...

FAILURE TEXT
You clearly wish to build the grand sand castle, and no
one can blame you for that!  However, your supplies of
resources are sadly too low to permit it.  Perhaps
you may have the reserves to build it up next time.
